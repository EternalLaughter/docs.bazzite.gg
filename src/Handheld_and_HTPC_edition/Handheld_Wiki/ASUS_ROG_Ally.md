- Virtual keyboard is Steam's keyboard, but needs to be setup in Steam's settings in Desktop Mode (See "Desktop Controls" section below)

  - If you encounter this, then try setting the VRAM in bios to **4GB** or **8GB**.

  - Steam Input's chords do not work by default.
    - Swapping the Start/Select button(s) is a workaround.

- Fingerprint driver does not work.
- Storage shows duplicate drives.
  - This is a visual bug, do **not** attempt to format this drive!

Read our [**Secure Boot guide**](/General/Installation_Guide/secure_boot.md#method-b-after-installation-method) to re-enroll the key after a BIOS update if you keep Secure Boot enabled, which is the default for this device.


### CPU Boost?

Disabled by default to prevent excessive power draw to the device.

More information can be found [**here**](https://github.com/aarron-lee/SimpleDeckyTDP/blob/main/README.md#are-there-cpu-boost-controls) about this.

### TDP Controls

![Settings Example|690x431, 75%](../../img/HHD_Settings_Example.jpeg)

Double-tap the Quick Access Menu button.

!!! note
    
    ASUS ROG Ally does not support **holding** for the QAM button!

### Controller Information

For most handheld hardware, besides the Steam Deck, emulation of a DualSense controller is used for full functionality. Double tap or hold the side menu button to access settings for controller emulation including switching to an Xbox controller with reduced functionality.

If your device has paddles, you will want to use the DualSense Edge controller. Itâ€™s disabled by default because some games do not map it correctly.

Some games and emulators may need Steam Input **disabled** to work correctly with your controls.

### Desktop Controls

Desktop Mode Controller Layout: It may not exist by default if Steam doesn't setup your handheld controller properly. This can be fixed in Steam's controller settings.
